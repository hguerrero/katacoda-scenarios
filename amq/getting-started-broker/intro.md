AMQ Broker is a pure-Java multiprotocol message broker. Itâ€™s built on an efficient, asynchronous core, with a fast native journal for message persistence and the option of shared-nothing state replication for high availability.

* **Persistence** - A fast, native-IO journal or a JDBC-based store
* **High availability** - Shared store or shared-nothing state replication
* **Advanced queueing** - Last value queues, message groups, topic hierarchies, and large message support
* **Multiprotocol** - AMQP 1.0, MQTT, STOMP, OpenWire, and HornetQ Core

AMQ Broker is based on the [Apache ActiveMQ Artemis](https://activemq.apache.org/artemis/) project.

In this tutorial you will learn how to create, configure and start a Red Hat AMQ message broker instance.
